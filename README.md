## Performance Test Interface

The Performance Test Interface (PTI) is a specification for performance testing tools, with a
focus on those that run on Kubernetes. It defines a common standard that can be
implemented by a variety of providers. This allows for both standardization for
end-users and innovation by providers of Performance Testing, Service Mesh, API Gatways, and Deployment Technologies. PTI enables
flexibility and interoperability, and covers most performance testing use-cases allowing for easy integrations for various different infrastructure and application delivery tool providers
